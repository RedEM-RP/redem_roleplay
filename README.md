OR

- Put fivem-mysql-async into server-data/resources/ and rename it to mysql-async

- Put the redem_roleplay folder in server-data/resources/[redemrp]/ - if you don't have [redemrp], just create a new one

- First start of server will create everything for you, all you have to do is make sure you have an active MySQL instance running and create a database named 'redemrp'

- Open your server.cfg and put below commands into it


```
set es_enableCustomData 1
set mysql_connection_string "server=ip;uid=user_name;password=very_secure_password;database=redemrp"
ensure esplugin_mysql
ensure mysql-async
ensure redem
ensure redem_roleplay
```
